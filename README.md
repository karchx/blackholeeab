# black hole (BHAEB)


## Project Goal

This project aims to build a simple **finite-state machine (FSM)** to model the lifecycle of black holes. While the current implementation is basic and conceptual, the long-term vision is to evolve this into a more ambitious and formal language capable of interpreting astrophysical phenomena through the lens of computer science.
